## A little bit about myself.

Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm Maya McDougall, a self-proclaimed "Digital Jill-of-all-Trades" (and master of none, I assure you 😅).

I'm an amateur app developer.  Check out my app [CheriPom](http://cheripom.mayamcdougall.me) for iOS (and watchOS)!  It's a minimalist pomodoro timer app to help you with your productivity.

I'm the primary support person for [PicoCMS](https://github.com/picocms/Pico), where I'm more than happy to answer any and all Pico-related questions.  I also maintain Pico's [website](https://picocms.org) and am working to rewrite Pico's aging documentation.

I'm an aspiring games developer, currently learning the in's and out's of [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

I also do a myriad of other things depending on the day, from writing fiction, to graphic design, to maintaining my personal Linux servers and VPSs.

I enjoy helping others with tech projects, and I'm always willing to help for the right cause.

I suppose I'm *technically* also available for hire, even if I'm not explicitly looking for work.  If for whatever reason something I've done has caught your interest, feel free to get in touch.

Feel free to reach out to me for anything in general... if you can figure out how (Idk, try Twitter or something). I used to get too much spam (and not much else) on my public email address, so I don't keep it listed online anymore. 😅

I'm also a safe person to talk to about anything LGBT+. 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️

My pronouns are She/Her.  If you think it's pretentious that they're listed here, I assure you, I didn't put them here for you. 🙄
